## ðŸš€ Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies:

- Terraform
  >Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files 
  >that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its 
  >lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS 
  >entries and SaaS features.
- Ansible
  >AnsibleÂ® is an open sourceIT automation tool that automates provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, 
  >and many other manual IT processes. Unlike more simplistic management tools, Ansible users (like system administrators, developers and architects) 
  >can use Ansible automation to install software, automate daily tasks, provision infrastructure, improve security and compliance, patch systems, 
  >and share automation across the entire organization.
- Aws Cloud
  >AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of infrastructure-as-a- service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and packaged-software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. 
  AWS services can offer an organization tools such as compute power, database storage and content delivery services.

## ðŸ’» Project

The ideia of this project is create an infrastruture using Terraform and ansible and then provide and automate this proccess creating an enviroment
for Development and Production. 
Finalling deploy a complete application on Production Server.
